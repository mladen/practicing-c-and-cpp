# How to use CMake
> Learning using ChatGPT

We need to execute `cmake ..` from our `/build` directory before running `make`. Here's what the `cmake ..` command does:

## What does 'cmake ..' do?

### **What `cmake ..` Does**

1. **Finds `CMakeLists.txt`:**  
   The `..` tells CMake to look for the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the parent directory (your project's root folder).

2. **Processes `CMakeLists.txt`:**  
   CMake reads the `CMakeLists.txt` file to:
   - Define the project structure.
   - Specify source files, include directories, and compiler options.
   - Locate required libraries (like OpenGL or GLFW in your case).

3. **Generates Build Files:**  
   CMake creates platform-specific build files.  
   - On Linux, it generates a `Makefile` (used by `make`).
   - On Windows, it could generate Visual Studio project files.
   - On macOS, it could create Xcode project files.

4. **Checks Dependencies:**  
   CMake ensures all necessary tools and libraries are available (e.g., OpenGL, GLFW). If a dependency is missing, it stops with an error.

5. **Configures the Build Directory:**  
   CMake organizes the build process in the `/build` directory, keeping your source folder clean.

### **Output of `cmake ..`**
1. **Generated Files in `/build`:**
   - `Makefile`: Instructions for `make` to compile and link the project.
   - `CMakeCache.txt`: Stores CMake's configuration and cached variables.
   - Other auxiliary files for tracking dependencies.

2. **Logs in Terminal:**  
   CMake outputs messages like:
   - Detected compilers (e.g., GCC or Clang).
   - Found libraries (e.g., OpenGL, GLFW).
   - Configuration success or errors.

### **Why It’s Necessary Before `make`**
`make` relies on the `Makefile` generated by `cmake ..`. Without running `cmake ..` first, `make` wouldn’t know:
- Which source files to compile.
- Which libraries to link.
- Where to place the final executable.

### **Command Breakdown**
- `cmake`: Invokes the CMake tool.
- `..`: Specifies the directory containing `CMakeLists.txt`.
