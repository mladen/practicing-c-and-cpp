## Advices

- [x] [Low Lever Learning - the TRUTH about C++ (is it worth your time?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1ZmFc-sqNc)
  - Learn C first
    - Don't learn C++ first (if it's your first language). Learn the fundamentals of memory management and control flow in C first. Then simplify your code with upgrades from the abstractions that the C++ language provides.
  - Don't use C++ features just because they exist
    - Use them because they solve a problem you have.
  - Learn a type safe language like Rust.

  > This is a course for students interested in learning the fundamentals of game programming and game engine architecture. Topics include an introduction to: vector math for games, rendering, animation, and artificial intelligence, collision detection, game physics, and user-interfaces. Students will be writing fully functional games using an ECS (Entities, Components, Systems) architecture, using the C++ programming language and the SFML graphics library.
